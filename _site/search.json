While the MRT network has been expanding across the many zones within Singapore, the bus network remains the most option accessible and reliable option amongst the two.\nThus, the utilisation pattern of buses are of key importance to multiple aspects of Singapore’s socio-economic spheres, ranging from areas of work productivity and efficiency, environmental impact, tourism, and even to potential impact to cost of living and real estate development; which underpins the impetus of this exercise to gain a better understanding of the utilisation patterns and characteristics of Singapore’s bus stops."

Further based on 9 weekend/holidays and 22 weekdays in October 2023, there is higher trips per day for weekdays as compared to weekdays.\nAmongst the bus stops, the highest number of trip origins across the 4 peak periods are from the bus interchanges; while by region, the northwestern and southwestern region of Singapore seems to have the least number of trip origins across the 4 peak periods.\nMaking a comparison between distribution by Total trips and Average trips reveals whether there isn’t a very noticeable difference, and hence the areas with higher passenger trip origins were largely attributed to popular bus stops within the hexagon, rather than the number of bus stops."
