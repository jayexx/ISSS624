## Overview

Hands-on experience on the following tasks:
- performing geocoding using data downloaded from data.gov.sg
- calibrating Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression

## Getting Started

The code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.

```{R}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse, httr)
```

## Geocoding using SLA API

Geocoding is the process of taking an aspatial description of a location and returning geographic coordinates

The found data will be joined with the initial csv data by using a unique identifier (i.e. POSTAL) common to both data tables. The output data table will then save as an csv file called found.

```{R}
#| eval: false
url<-"https://www.onemap.gov.sg/api/common/elastic/search"

csv<-read_csv("data/aspatial/Generalinformationofschools.csv")
postcodes<-csv$'postal_code'

found<-data.frame()
not_found<-data.frame()

for(postcode in postcodes){
  query<-list('searchVal'=postcode, 'returnGeom'='Y', 'getAddrDetails'='Y','pageNum'='1')
  res<- GET(url,query=query)
  
  if((content(res)$found)!=0){
    found<-rbind(found,data.frame(content(res))[4:13])
  } else{
    not_found = data.frame(postcode)

  }
}
```

Next, combine both found and not_found data.frames into a single data.frame called merged. At the same time, write merged and not_found tibble data.fraems into csv file

```{R}
#| eval: false
merged = merge(csv, found,by.x = 'postal_code', by.y = 'results.POSTAL', all = TRUE)
write.csv(merged,file = "data/aspatial/schools.csv")
write.csv(not_found,file = "data/aspatial/not_found.csv")
```

##### Do it yourself
- Using Google map, locate the location info of the ungeocoded school (zhenghua secondary) by using its postcode.
- Update the results.LATITUDE and results.LONGITUDE fields of the ungeocoded record in schools.csv manually
- For Zhenghua Secondary update longlat as 1.389279, 103.7651 

## Converting an aspatial data into a simple feature tibble data.frame

### Importing and tidying schools data

Importing and tidying schools data, rename latitude & longitude and retain

```{R}
schools<-read_csv("data/aspatial/schools.csv") %>%
  rename(latitude = "results.LATITUDE",
         longitude = "results.LONGITUDE")%>%
  select(postal_code, school_name, latitude, longitude)
```

### Converting an aspatial data into sf tibble data.frame

Convert aspatial data into a simple feature tibble data.frame called schools_sf

```{R}
schools_sf <- st_as_sf(schools,
                       coords = c("longitude","latitude"),
                       crs=4326) %>%
st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

### Plotting a point simple feature layer

Ensure schools_sf tibble data.frame has been projected and converted correctly, you can plot the schools point data for visual inspection.

create a point symbol map showing the location of 

```{R}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MPSZ-2019")%>%
st_transform(crs = 3414)
school_mpsz <- st_intersects(mpsz, schools_sf)

tmap
```


## Preparing

count the number of schools within each planning subzone by using appropriate sf function

```{R}
mpsz$'SCHOOL_COUNT'<-lengths(
  st_intersects(
    mpsz, schools_sf))
```

Good practice to examine summary stat of derived variable.

compute and display summary stat of sch_count field.

```{R}
summary(mpsz$SCHOOL_COUNT)
```

```{R}
business_sf = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MPSZ-2019")%>%
st_transform(crs = 3414)

```

```{R}
tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)
tm_shape(mpsz) + #plot outline
  tm_polygons() + 
tm_shape(business_sf) + #plot specific retail outlets
  tm_dots()
```

```{R}
flow_data <- flow_data %>%
  left_join(mpsz_tidy, 
            by = c("DESTIN_SZ" = "SUBZONE_C"))
```
